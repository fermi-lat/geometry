/**
	Trap is the same as the GEANT volume of the same name, but note that
	GEANT uses half-lengths as parameters, whereas we use full
	lengths.<BR>
	A Trap is defined by the  6 planes which bound it.
	It is a generalized trapezoidal volume.
	The GEANT specification for this shape takes 11 parameters as
	described below, but, as noted by the authors, only 9 of them are 
	independent.
	Here, we use only the 9 independent parameters, eliminating the ones
	indicated below.  <BR>
	The 11 GEANT parameters are
        <OL>
	 <LI> the full length in z
	 <LI> the polar angle of the center of the -z face to the center of 
		the +z face
	 <LI> the azimuthal angle of the center of the -z face to the center
		of the +z face
		Since this parameter is not independent of overall rotations,
		THIS PARAMETER IS not used!
	 <LI> the full length in y of the -z face
	 <LI> the full length in x of the low y edge of the -z face
	 <LI> the full length in x of the high y edge of the -z face
	 <LI> the angle with respect to the y-axis from the center of the
		low y edge to the center of the high y edge of the -z face
	 <LI> the full length in y of the +z face
	<LI> the full length in x of the low y edge of the +z face
	<LI> the full length in x of the high y edge of the +z face
	<LI> the angle with respect to the y-axis from the center of the
		low y edge to the center of the high y edge of the +z face
		Since this parameter must be equal to 7) in order for all
		faces to form planes,
		THIS PARAMETER IS not used!
       </OL>
